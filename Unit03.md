**Unit 3: Intercultural Relationships** <span id="3"></span> 
*Technology and mobility are responsible for increased interactions
among people from all parts of the world, allowing for the development
of relationships in amazing and varied ways.  It is true that two
individuals who share values and cultural characteristics may be more
inclined to develop a relationship with one another than, say, two
individuals who hail from two very distinct cultures with two very
distinct belief sets.  However, the number of relationships among
members of different cultures (be it business or interpersonal)
continues to rise, because it has become easier to access and
communicate with others around the world due to advances in technology. 
The interrelatedness of the twenty-first century also brings members of
different cultures together in the same space in a manner that has not
been seen before.  Therefore, the development and maintenance of
relationships among members of different cultures are possibly more
important and more prevalent than at any other time in our history.*  
  
 *This unit will address some of the considerations that come into play
in the development of intercultural relationships.*
