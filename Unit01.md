**Unit 1: Communication among Cultures** <span id="1"></span> 
*As you have surely experienced many times, communication between
members of the same culture can be challenging and can often be hampered
by misunderstanding, confusion, and a lack of shared meaning.  These
miscommunications can take place despite the fact that members of the
same culture often share beliefs and worldviews.  Miscommunication can
be prevalent despite the appearance that people are communicating
successfully, because they share a language.  Communication failure
stems from issues of individualism versus collectivism (individual
orientation vs. group orientation), masculinity versus femininity, power
distance (relationships between those with and without power),
uncertainty avoidance (level of comfort with uncertainty), and long-term
versus short-term orientation.*  
  
 *When individuals from different cultures engage in communication, the
opportunity for miscommunication multiplies.  The list of variables that
can come into play grows exponentially as the communication situation
changes from a shared cultural perspective to two or more cultures
represented by the people talking together.  For example, if you are in
a business meeting with others, including a man from Nigeria, you might
notice some communication differences between the man and the others in
the meeting.  If he is younger or a subordinate to you, he will likely
avoid eye contact.  While you might consider this a sign of nervousness
or deception, he would likely be avoiding eye contact out of respect for
you.*  
  
 *Understanding some primary differences in cultural communication
practices can serve as a starting point for developing intercultural
communication competence by helping you better understand how to
communicate among cultures.  This unit will explore differences in
cultural communication practices.*
