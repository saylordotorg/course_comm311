**Unit 2: Adapting to Culture** <span id="2"></span> 
*Communication between members of two cultures frequently requires more
than a single interaction.  Business partnerships, social relationships,
and organizational affiliations can require a prolonged exposure to
other cultures.  In these cases, those who interact with other cultures
must move beyond understanding the basics of intercultural communication
differences and come to understand how perceptions and culture-oriented
behavior differences complicate the ability to communicate.*  
  
 *This unit will help you understand how the perception-making process
is challenged when cultural differences exist.  The unit also will
introduce the concept of culture shock and how it must be managed so
that one can communicate with competence in another culture.*
