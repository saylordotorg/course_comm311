**Unit 4: Insights into Cultural Communication Practices** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Thus far, this course has addressed intercultural communication
differences from a broad perspective.  This unit will look at individual
cultures and the communication behaviors that operate within those
particular populations.  Recognition of these cultural practices can
facilitate competent communication on a professional, social, or casual
level.  This particular unit focuses mostly on a U.S. worldview,
addressing cultures found in the United States.  It is important to
remember that members of other cultures have to adapt to living in the
United States, which can be a challenging adjustment.  Likewise the
United States has a melting pot of cultures, and an Americans may have
to adapt to ethnicities and cultures that differ from their own.  As you
work through this unit, consider how you might adapt to American culture
or how as an American that you might adapt to a culture within the
United States that differs from your own.*
